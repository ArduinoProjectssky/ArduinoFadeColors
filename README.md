# FadeColors

## Description
FadeColors is an Arduino project designed to create smooth color fading effects using the HW-479 LED.

## Components Required
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.)
- HW-479 RGB LED
- 3 x 220立 resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires (for connections)

## Wiring Instructions
### HW-479 LED Wire Colors
- **Red Wire (R)**: Red (for the red LED)
- **Green Wire (G)**: Green (for the green LED)
- **Blue Wire (B)**: Blue (for the blue LED)
- **Black Wire (-)**: Black (common cathode connection)

### Summary of Connections
- **Red Wire (Red)**: Connects to Pin 9 on the Arduino (through a 220立 resistor).
- **Green Wire (Green)**: Connects to Pin 10 on the Arduino (through a 220立 resistor).
- **Blue Wire (Blue)**: Connects to Pin 11 on the Arduino (through a 220立 resistor).
- **Black Wire (Black)**: Connects to GND on the Arduino.
